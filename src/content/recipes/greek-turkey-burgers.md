# Instructions

1. In a bowl, combine all burger ingredients. Use your hands to mix!
2. Form into patties, I used about 1/3 â€“ 1/2 cup of meat for each.
3. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet with 2 tbsp avocado oil over medium heat, and once hot, add burgers.
4. Cook for 5 minutes, flip, then turn the heat to medium low. Cover for the next 5 minutes so the inside cooks. Repeat until all burgers are cooked.

## Meanwhile, make the tzatziki sauce

1. Placed diced cucumber with a sprinkle of salt in a bowl and let sit for 10 minutes to release any extra moisture.
2. Meanwhile, mix together yogurt, lemon juice, dill, garlic, salt and pepper.
3. Drain cucumber, then add it in and stir to combine. Taste and add any additional salt or pepper.
